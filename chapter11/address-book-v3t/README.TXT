A simple address-book implementation.
This version includes some argument-validity checking.

How to start this project:
    Either: Create an AddressBook object and add
    contact details (such as name, address, and phone) to it.
    Or: create an AddressBookDemo and call its showInterface method.
    This will create a sample AddressBook along with a text
    interface for the purposes of interactive experimentation.
