This project provides a partial implementation of a simulation of
taxis operating on a city grid to pick up and transport passengers.
    
This is the second stage of this project. It illustrates some basic
testing of the outline implementation.

How to start this project:
    Create an OutlineTesting object and invoke its runTests method.
    At least one of the tests will fail.
