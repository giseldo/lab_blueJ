This project provides a partial implementation of a simulation of
taxis operating on a city grid to pick up and transport passengers.
    
This is the first stage of this project. It illustrates an outline 
implementation form derived from CRC interaction.

How to start this project:
    Create a Demo object and invoke its demo method.
    However, as there are no vehicles created, no passengers
    will ever be picked up.

    Create at least one Taxi in the constructor of TaxiCompany and
    add it to the vehicles collection. Then a passenger will have
    a taxi scheduled to pick them up. However, as vehicles do not
    yet move, they never will be picked up.
